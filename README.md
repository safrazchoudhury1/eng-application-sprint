# Engineering Application Sprint (Fall 2025)

Daily prep for Ontario engineering applications: coding practice, math contest solutions, and one demo engineering project.

## Structure
- `coding/` — solved programming problems (source files + short notes)
- `math/` — contest-style solutions (PDF or photo)
- `project/` — small engineering project with plan and demo
- `LOG.md` — daily log with evidence (what was done, links to code, etc.)

## Goals
- Regular coding practice
- Written math solutions
- Build and iterate on a real engineering project
